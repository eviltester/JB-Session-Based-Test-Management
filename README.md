JB-Session-Based-Test-Management
================================

A VB front end to James Bach Session Based Test Management Tool.

Back in 2001 and 2002 I was experimenting with [Session Based Test Management](http://www.satisfice.com/sbtm/) and using the [perl based management scripts](http://www.satisfice.com/sbtm/sessions.exe) that James Bach created.

I was using VB6 back then so this app src code uses VB6.

All it really does is act as a GUI for the creation of files suitable for parsing by James' scripts.

You have to amend the data files first:
- Paths.txt (where to find and write the files)
- Testers.txt (who do add to the Testers drop down)
- Coverage.ini (the coverage areas to add to the report)

I don't use it, and haven't for years. Released in the hope that it proves useful to someone, or acts as a historic curio.
